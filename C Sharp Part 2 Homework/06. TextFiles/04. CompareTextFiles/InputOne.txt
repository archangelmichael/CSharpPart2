"Wake YOU Up"

Feeling YOUR way through the darkness
Guided by a beating heart
YOU can't tell where the journey will end
But YOU know where to start

They tell YOU YOU're too young to understand
They say YOU're caught up in a dream
Well life will pass me by if YOU don't open up YOUR eyes
Well that's fine by YOU

[2x]
So wake YOU up when it's all over
When YOU're wiser and YOU're older
All this time YOU WERE finding myself
And YOU didn't know YOU was lost
